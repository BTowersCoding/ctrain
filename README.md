# ctrain

I wanted to be able to run the problems on 4clojure without having to load a browser or even a desktop session, so I took the data and created a little text-based runner. It only does the first test of each problem, for simplicity. 

## Installation

Simply clone this repository, assuming you have Java and Leiningen installed.

## Usage

cd into project directory and type lein run.

## TODO

Make it save your progress.
