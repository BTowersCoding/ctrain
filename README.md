# ctrain

I wanted to be able to run the problems on 4clojure without having to load a browser or even a desktop session, so I took the data and created a little text-based runner.

## Installation

Simply clone this repository, assuming you have Java and Leiningen installed.

## Usage

cd into project directory and type lein run.
